// To play Minesweeper, we will create instances of MineSweeperGame in command line.
// For example:
// In the command line, navigate to the lib directory and run `node`
// Run `.load game.js` to load the contents of this file.
// Then create a Game instance and run commands like so:
// let game = new Game(3, 3, 3);
// game.playMove(0, 1);
// game.playMove(1, 2);
// When done run `.exit`

import { Board } from './board';

class Game {
	constructor (numberOfRows, numberOfColumns, numberOfBombs) {
		this._board = new Board(numberOfRows, numberOfColumns, numberOfBombs);
		//console.log(this._board);
	}

	playMove(rowIndex, columnIndex) {
		this._board.flipTile(rowIndex, columnIndex);
		if (this._board.playerBoard[rowIndex][columnIndex] === 'b') {
			console.log('Game over!');
			this._board.print();
		} else if (!this._board.hasSafeTiles()) {
			console.log('You won!');
		} else {
			console.log('Current Board: ');
			this._board.print();
		}
	}
}

// Add validation to ensure that board dimensions make sense. 
//For example, a board should not be able to be created with more bombs than it has tiles.

// Add a timer which lets players know how long it took them to win (or lose).

// Add recursive flipping, when a tile is flipped that isn't touching a bomb 
//(would have the number zero printed on it), all adjacent tiles additionally flip over.

// Add a method to place flags at a tile instead of flipping that tile. 
//If a square has a flag on it, it can't be flipped over.
